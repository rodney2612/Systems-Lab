How to run?
Run ./prob1.sh filename
eg ./prob1.sh 1G.txt

Creating files of varying sizes:
For 1 GB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1GB count=1

For 1 MB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1MB count=1

For 1 KB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1KB count=1

For 500 KB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1KB count=500

For 10 MB file
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1MB count=10

For 150 MB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1MB count=150

For 450 MB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1MB count=450

For 750 MB file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file bs=1MB count=750

No of Page faults has been counted using 2 techniques:
1. Using rusage system call
2. Using perf event open system call(Just so as to verify whether I am getting accurate results using rusage)
The same values are obtained using both rusage and perf event system calls

Using rusage:
Main initially counts the no of major and minor page faults using rusage system call
Then it dioes a file read using mmap via the fileread function.
Then it again counts the no of major and minor page faults using rusage system call
The actual no of major page faults for file read is just the difference between the no of major 
faults before file read and after file read. Same is the case for no of minor page faults.
